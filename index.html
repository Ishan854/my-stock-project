        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p><br>A stock market (also known as an equity market or share market), is a collection of buyers and sellers of stocks. These stocks represent ownership interests in companies. These may include publicly or privately traded securities. The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is an example of a share market.
Usually, large companies will list their stock on a stock exchange because it makes their shares more liquid (i.e., easy to buy and sell), which investors love. This liquidity also attracts international investors.
As of 2017, the Global Stock Market is now worth a record $76.3 Trillion. The NYSE has a market capitalization of roughly $21 trillion and is the largest stock market in the world.</p>
